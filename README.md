Sample app for teaching Alan node.js.

Setting Up the App:
-------------------

1. `git clone  ....`
2. In the app directory, run `npm install` to install the required modules.
3. Copy the `.env.sample` file to a `.env` file. Add your Forecast.io API Key.
4. In the terminal, run `npm start` to start the app. Alternatively, to get automatic app refresh on save, run `node-dev index.js`.

Things to Do:
------------

1. ~~Add `dotenv` node module and move the API Key into the .env file (don't forget to `gitignore` it!).~~
2. ~~Update the app to use a templating engine such as EJS or handlebars.~~
3. ~~Move the API call to a separate file.~~
4. Explore Async.js callbacks vs. promises.
5. Add tests!
6. Create a routes file that gets called from index.js.
7. Update the app to respond to a user-provided location.
